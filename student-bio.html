					Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Latin gibberish used in place of actual words, because having to think of actual words is for suckers. Fun fact about D.B.Desai, Dhaval was once shot in the face with a paintball gun. The paintball from said gun struck Dhaval a millimeter from his right eye, when the field referee radioed basecamp the first question asked was "Uh...Is his eye hanging out?", That sucked. Etiam blandit purus metus, sed ornare quam ullamcorper et. When Dhaval Desai was in the third grade he won the Martin Luther King Jr. inter-grade chess championship, he refers to himself as "The Champ" to this very day. In pulvinar dui et nulla dapibus laoreet. In his youth Desai once shot a rabbit with a green plastic BB, later ,Wracked with guilt he had an epiphany to never shoot animals with BB's ever again. Promise = kept (mostly). Nulla facilisi. Ut lacinia commodo mattis. Dhaval "played" the trumpet in the school band for 3 years. In his 4th year he was removed for not actually playing but simply copying the hand movements of the trumpeter next to him. He thought this was BS (yet fair)

					In 2005 D.B.Desai went "expert level" canyoning in the swiss alps, this turned out to be both an exhilarating adventure and a terrifying ordeal for Desai. There is PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE of this. Nulla ante sem, blandit in erat et, hendrerit fringilla mi. Desai is well know for being a superb cook. Pellentesque eu volutpat sem, id pulvinar arcu. Mr Desai once wrote a play called “jive turkey: a drama in 5 acts”, it was hailed by the new york times as an instant modern day classic. Those in attendance for its one and only showing said of the show; “good time had by all”.  Curabitur eget condimentum tortor. Chateau neuf de paap, with crackers and tiny fish eggs. Proin pellentesque elit et eleifend cursus. Nulla id diam eleifend augue dapibus mollis. Dhaval has never in his life killed an animal, he counts himself lucky in this regard.
