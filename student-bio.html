					Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Latin gibberish used in place of actual words, because having to think of actual words is for suckers. Fun fact about D.B.Desai, Dhaval was once shot in the face with a paintball gun. The paintball from said gun struck Dhaval a milimeter from his right eye, when the feild refere radioed the basecamp the first question asked was "So...Is his eye hanging out?". That sucked. Etiam blandit purus metus, sed ornare quam ullamcorper et. When Dhaval Desai was in the third grade he won the Martin Luther King Jr. inter-grade chess championchip, he refers to himself as "The Champ" to this very day. In pulvinar dui et nulla dapibus laoreet. In his youth Desai once shot a rabbit with a green plastic BB, later ,Wracked with guilt he had an epifany to never shoot animals with BB's ever agian. Promise = kept (mostly). Nulla facilisi. Ut lacinia commodo mattis. Dhaval "played" the trumpet in the school band for 3 years. In his 4th year he was removed for not actually playing but simply copying the hand movments of the trumpeter next to him. He thought this was BS (yet fair)

					In 2005 DBDesai went "expert level" canyoning in the swiss alps, this turned out to be both an exliratoijg adventure and a terrifying ordeal for Desai. There is PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE of this. Nulla ante sem, blandit in erat et, hendrerit fringilla mi. Desai is well know for being a superb cook. Pellentesque eu volutpat sem, id pulvinar arcu. Sed sapien magna, imperdiet mollis cursus ac, tristique vitae neque. Sed porttitor rutrum gravida. In tincidunt vulputate orci eget aliquet. Donec purus augue, porttitor quis facilisis vel, scelerisque eget est. Curabitur eget condimentum tortor. Nunc vel efficitur nisi, non ultricies tortor. Proin pellentesque elit et eleifend cursus. Nulla id diam eleifend augue dapibus mollis. Cras tincidunt felis ut consequat tincidunt. Nulla sit amet mollis orci, vel sollicitudin lorem.
